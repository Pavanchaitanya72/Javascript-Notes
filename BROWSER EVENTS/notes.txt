DOM EVENTS:

Mouse Events - click, context menu(right click), mouseover/mouseout, mousedown/mouseup, mousemove

Keyboard events - keydown and keyup

form element events - submit, focus etc.

Document events - DOMContentLoaded

Handling Events - Events can be handled through HTML attributes.

<input value="hey" onclick="alert('hey)" type="button">

events can be handled through "onclick".

ADD AND REMOVE EVENT LISTENERS

element.addEventListener(event, handler)

element.removeEventListener(event, handler)

removeEventListener works when function objcet is same.

EVENT OBJECT:

when an event happens, the browser creates an event object, puts details into it and passes it as an argument to the handler.
elem.onclick=function(event){
    ......
}
event.type : Event type
event.current Target : element that handled the event.
event.clientX / event.clientY: coordinates of the cursor.
