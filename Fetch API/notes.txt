Java Script can be used to send and return information from the network when needed(AJAX).
Fetch API -
fetch is used to get data over the network.
let f=fetch(url,[options]) {without options a get request is sent.}

getting a response is a 2-stage process:
1. An object of response class containing "status" & "ok" properties.
status: The http status code, eg.200
ok: boolean true if the HTTP status code is 200-299.

2. After that we need to call another method to access the body in different formats:
    response.text() - Read and return the text.
    response.json() - parse the response as JSON.
    othe methods include response.form data(), response.blob(), 

Response headers-
The response headers are available in response headers.

Request headers -
To set a request header in fetch, we can use the headers option.
let res=fetch(url, {
    headers:{
        Authentication:"secret"
    }
})
